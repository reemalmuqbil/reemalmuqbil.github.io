## Introduction 

## Methodology 

### 1. Dataset acquisition and EDA 
This article is going to use a popular open source dataset called [MNIST original](https://www.kaggle.com/avnishnish/mnist-original). It is a dataset consisting of 70,000 images of handwritten digits. The features are the pixels of the image which are 784 pixels and a class label which is the digit value.
This is what the dataset looks like:
