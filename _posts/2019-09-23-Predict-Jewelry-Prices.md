### Introduction
This project’s idea hit me when I was thinking: Wouldn’t it be amazing to automate the role of jewelers or at least some of their functions? I mean, imagine having a robot or a system such that given a set of features of jewelry piece specifications, it can approximate its market value. I figured, why not build a Machine Learning model that can predict the prices of jewelry pieces given their characteristics. 


### Hypothesis 
It’s commonly known that jewelry prices are correlated with their weight, purity, and the characteristics of the stones if included. Therefore, I believe that a Linear regression model can perform well under these circumstances where the predicted value is continuous in nature and some of the features as well.
